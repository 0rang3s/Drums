# Drums
Drumset made using onlyFrameworks C++ libaray 


This project is a DrumKit Visualizer created using openFrameworks. It allows users to visualize and interact with virtual drums on the screen. Users can adjust various parameters such as drum size, color, pitch, volume, and speed using graphical user interface (GUI) sliders. Additionally, users can trigger drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding virtual drums with the mouse.

## Features:

- Visual representation of snare, bass, hi-hat, and cymbal drums.
- Adjustable parameters for each drum, including size, color, pitch, volume, and speed.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy parameter adjustments.
- Ability to save and load settings using XML files.
- Keyboard shortcuts for hiding/showing GUI, saving/loading settings, and resetting parameters.
- Real-time sound playback triggered by mouse clicks on the virtual drums.
- Automatic adjustment of circle resolution based on user-defined parameters.
